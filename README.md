# Automated-motor-by-sensing-moisture

One of the largest user of fresh water in agriculture is irrigation. Water scarcity is one of the major problems in our country, automation of irrigation system based on soil moisture content could reduce the water wastage. The working of a surface irrigation system might be enhanced by using an automatic IoT system. Our device collects soil moisture content and based on the value, if it is below the lower threshold value then the water motor turns ON automatically. When the value of the soil moisture content reaches an upper threshold value then the water motor turns OFF automatically. This system also contains an OLED display to show the value of soil moisture content. The Blynk app software sends a notification to farmer, when the content of soil moisture is less than lower threshold.  Since the farmer will not be available at the farm all the time, this device will take care of the moisture content in the soil. This reduces the wastage of water.
